        <div class="child-1"><h1>VIRAT KOHLI</h1>
            <p>Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and a former captain of the India national cricket team.A right-handed top-order batsman, he has made 81 centuries in international cricketâ€”thirty in Test cricket, fifty in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one in Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) as of November 2024.[a]
                Kohli made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in August 2008,[2] and scored his first century the following year when he made 107 against the same team at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. His 86-ball 133 not out against Sri Lanka in February 2012 led India to the second highest run-chase by any team in Australia.[b][4][5] Former Australian cricketer Dean Jones described the innings as "One of the greatest ODI knocks of all time!".[6] Kohli's highest score of 183 came against Pakistan during the 2012 Asia Cup; India successfully chased a target of 330 set by Pakistan and Kohli was adjudged man of the match. Following that, he made his first century as a captain while playing against the West Indies in the 2013 Triangular Series.[7] In the bilateral series against Australia in October 2013, Kohli made two centuries in successful run-chases. The first of the two, 100 not out, was scored off 52 balls and remains the fastest ODI century by an Indian.[8] The next century, which was scored off 61 balls, remains the third-fastest by an Indian as of September 2019.[9] In November 2023, he went past Sachin Tendulkar's record for most ODI centuries when he made his 50th century in the format; he scored 117 against New Zealand at the 2023 Cricket World Cup knockout stage.[10][11][12]</p>
